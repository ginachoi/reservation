# ReservationService
The reservation service helps both owner and customer to make reservations.
* A restaurant has 4 tables of capacity 1,2,3 and 4 seats
* Two reservations can be made at the same time of multiple seating capacities. Cannot make more than two reservations.
* No single reservation can be greater than 10 people
* No waitlist - successful reservation or failed reservation are the only 2 states possible
* Customer and Owner are the only 2 people who will use this API
* Both customer and owner can make/cancel a reservation.

- Create 3 REST APIs
- As a User (customer or owner), I want to make a reservation
- As a User, I want to cancel a reservation
- As a User, at any given point, I want to check which tables are free and of what



### Use Case
* Either customers and owner make a query to get a list of table status
* Both customer and owner can make reservations
* Customer can view reservations that he/she made. Owner can view the entire reservations
* Both customer and owner can cancel reservations. Customers only cancel own reservations
* Owner can cancel any reservations
* Both owner and user can cancel one reservation at a time
